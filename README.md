# AzureNamingConvention
as you start to use very many azure resources, you will begin to use a naming convention to find a specific resource quickly.    
Unfortunately there are the naming limits to the different resource types. This makes it difficult to use a convention straitforward if not planned carefully first. The most enoying is the limit to 15 characters name length (Virtual Machine).
